* class definition style & standards:  first, member vars  none per line and do not forget to initialize them;  second functions: separate group of functions  by a blank line; either matching setter/getter pairs or list all setters back to back and list all getters back to back; start with a default c’tor, followed by  copy c’tor (if any), then other c’tors in the order of increased number of arguments, d’tor- right after c’tor(s), overloaded functions- list them back to back in the order of increased number of arguments;  all accessor/getter functions should be const; all functions with more than one statement should be normal (defined externally, outside of the class and below main()), no inline functions with more than one statement; initialize all member variables to appropriate default values at the time of definition; all member variables must be private; classes must provide a strong exception guarantee; must have default c’tor; implement Rule of Three when necessary
* To provide you with thorough feedback, your instructor reads your code line by line, sometimes multiple times. Jumping from file to file is too time-consuming. Unless noted otherwise, place your class definitions above the main() and all function definitions below main(), all in one file. While the industry standard involves multi-source file programs, we will use a single file format for these labs unless instructed otherwise.
* Posted instructions are not optional, and not following the instructions will result in a lower grade. It applies to all assignments in this course.
*  70  and like global var(s); only constant may be global -5
* 214 causes memory leak -10
* getting and returning a valid denominator should be a separate function -2
* 85 and like:<< not needed between strings -1
* poor Id(s)  and/or inconsistent naming convention; ids should be self-documenting and as short as possible; use verbs for functions and nouns for variables; use camel-casing for variables (errorMessage) enum & const should be in upper case with words separated by “_”, e.g., MAX_TERMS, PRINT_RECORDS; pointer variables should start with p( if single)  or pp( if double pointer); flags isValid ( clearly what true would mean); if copying – e.g rhsQueue or scrQueue ; do not use IDs that are same as or very similar to C++  keywords and functions; no need to call an array “array”- it is obvious; vars should not be called value; -2
